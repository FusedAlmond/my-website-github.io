          <p>The Canadian National Railroad is a Canadian class 1 railroad founded in 1919. It was a goverment owned and ran railroad untill 1995 when it became a privatly owned company. Although Canadian National is know for it's frieght service, CN did have passenger service until 1978 when it was taken over by VIA Rail. In 1995 the Canadian Government privatized the company and it expanded into the United States. With the expantion south it purchased some railroad including, The Illinois Central, Wisconsin Central, Central Vermont and a few other smaller class 2 and 3 shortlines. Some of these railroads live on in CN's roster still in original paint (IC 1028 is my personal favourite as it was the first fallen flag locomotive I seen). Canadian National is mostly know for it's railways although it did own some boats aswell as some hotels. CN to this day is and always will be my favourite railroad.
